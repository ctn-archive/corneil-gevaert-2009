Working memory for multidimensional functions
=============================================

This project is an extension of the dynamic working memory example
presented in section 8.3 of Neural Engineering (Eliasmith and
Anderson, 2003), much of the system description overlaps. The
subpopulation under consideration in that case was the Lateral
Intraparietal Area (LIP) of the neocortex of macaque monkeys. This
population exhibits the behaviour of storing memories of salient
stimuli, and has been studied extensively by researchers. The results
of these studies indicate that multiple bumps of varying heights can
be encoded by the LIP to represent multiple stimuli in the spatial
field (represented by `v`), as well as a non-spatial characteristic of
each stimulus `f(v)`. Research by Colby and Goldberg suggests that
`f(v)` represents the attentional resources given to the stimuli,
while research by Andersen et al. suggests that it represents
intention to move to the object.

This model and report compares 1D and 2D working memory in terms of
RMS and stability. It also incorporates methods for running function
representation simulations in Nengo. Here are some cool movies
referred to in the report: spikes movie, 2000 neurons, 40 dimensions
and 20 dimensions.
